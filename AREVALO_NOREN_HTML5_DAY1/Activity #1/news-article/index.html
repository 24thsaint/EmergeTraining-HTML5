                <p>MANILA - House Majority Leader Rodolfo Fariñas said Thursday he would file a bill to transfer the power to regulate and grant licenses to casinos to Congress from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.</p>

                <p>"PAGCOR is the sole authority that grants licenses, authorizes them, regulates them, and it’s also a gambling operator. We have to remove all of those and give back to Congress the power regulate all of these," Fariñas told ANC's Headstart.</p>

                <p>Congress should be given such powers over the gaming industry in the same way that it has the power to grant franchises to television stations.</p>

                <p>Fariñas was among the legislators who investigated last week's attack on Resorts World Manila, which left dozens killed after a lone suspect fired shots and set the casino floor on fire.</p>

                <p>The lawmaker said it was clear that the resort casino, located in front of Manila's main airport, had lapses in security and was unprepared for an attack.</p>
